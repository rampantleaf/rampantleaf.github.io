    <h1>Extracting GFX Files</h1>
    
    <p>
      <b>Requirements: </b>
      <ul>
        <li>Hex Editor (<a href="https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/">like HxD</a>)</li>
        <li>Flash Decompiler (<a href="https://www.free-decompiler.com/flash/">like JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler</a>)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Steps: </b>
    </p>
    
    <p>Wolfered at bugbeargames.com did a great job at explaining the steps in <a href="http://community.bugbeargames.com/index.php?topic=3131.0">this fourms post</a>. Although the steps will be a little bit different for your use, the steps listed there are generally the same. There's no need to export your file to FLA unless you plan on editing it.</p>

      <b>Notes: </b>
      <ul>
        <li>This isn't extremely useful since all I was able to pull out of it were font files. I'm assuming the GFX files rely on other files in its original directory.</li>
      </ul>
