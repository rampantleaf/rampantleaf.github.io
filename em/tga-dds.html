    <h1>Viewing TGA/DDS Files</h1>
    <p><b>Applies to: Epic Mickey, Epic Mickey 2</b></p>
    
    <p>
      Download Paint.NET and open your files in there. Paint.NET is a free, open source photo editor that is capable of opening, editing and saving TGA and DDS files.

    <b>Notes: </b>
    <ul>
      <li>I'm not sure if modifying any of the TGA and DDS files actually has an effect on the game. There seem to be equivelant NIF files for most of them.</li>
      <li>There are some temporary files of this kind in HUDElements\Flash\cooked\ in the first game.</li>
    </ul>
